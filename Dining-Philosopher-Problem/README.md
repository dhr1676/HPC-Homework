# Dining-Philosopher-Problem-OpenMP

(40) In 1965, Edsgar Dijkstra described the following problem. Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when she has both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher, and so, a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After she finishes eating, she needs to put down both forks so they become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on her right or the one on her left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both of them. Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. 

Implement a solution for an unbounded number of philosophers, where each philosopher is implemented as a thread, and the forks are the synchronizations needed between them. Develop this threaded program in pthreads.  The program takes as an input parameter the number of philosophers.  The program needs to print out the state of the table (philosophers and forks) â€“ the format is up to you.
